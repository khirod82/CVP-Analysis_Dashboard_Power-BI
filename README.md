ðŸš€ **Excited to Share My Latest Project!** ðŸš€

I recently completed a detailed Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) analysis dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. This powerful tool allowed me to analyze key metrics such as Sales, Costs, and Profits across various categories, regions, and time periods.

ðŸ“Š **Key Highlights:**
- Comprehensive visualization of sales and profit distribution by sub-category.
- Detailed insights into order quantities by region and customer segments.
- Impact analysis showing the effect size of sales on profit.

This project has been a great learning experience, leveraging Power BI's capabilities to turn complex data into actionable insights. Special thanks to my mentors and colleagues for their support throughout this journey!
